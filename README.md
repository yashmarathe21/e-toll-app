## Automated E-Toll System

### Introduction

With the growth in the number of vehicles, the need for expansive roads catering to
thousands of motor vehicles transverse across India has become inevitable. The revenue required
for the same is collected mainly through toll booths. However, considering the present situation
the modern toll system has some limitations due to the manual collection. This has proved to
delay and crowding near the toll systems majorly caused due to the manual money exchange and
improper lane management. The implementation of ‘FASTag’ has hardly proved to reduce this
traffic and hence it is required to automate the system using the License Plate of the vehicle
which is an existing and unique feature of any vehicle.

We have proposed a system that majorly consists of License Plate Recognition and the Android
Application. It is designed such that the response time of the system is as little as possible. The
implementation of e-wallet helps to integrate with Paytm, PayPal and Internet Banking. ​ Hybrid
lanes, which are yet to go cashless after the latest extended relaxation of FASTag for a month,
are experiencing long queues resulting in a massive traffic jam at the various toll plazas.
